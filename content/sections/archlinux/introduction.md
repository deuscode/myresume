This project will go through my experience on installing and configuring an
Arch Linux system and how I interpret how it should look/function. I've been a
big Windows user for a long time during my career and have worked in mixed
Linux/Windows environments. I recently made the switch to use Linux as my main
Operating System (OS) driver in 2017 to optimize my workflow both at home and at
Stack Overflow.
